# webdev-practice
A collection of static webpages/layouts/components/widgets/etc. to improve my HTML/CSS/JS. This will be a mix of replicating features or designs that I find interesting and design ideas that come to me. Essentially CodePen but on GitHub. I'm by no means great at CSS, but hopefully getting better every day!
